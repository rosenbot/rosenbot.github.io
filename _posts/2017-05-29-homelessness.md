With the homelessness situation at a crisis level, the time for decisive action is now. Instead, the
City Council waits for the mayor to craft halfhearted solutions which do not address the short, medium,
or long term problems facing our city or our homeless community. In fact, the problems we currently
face are largely due to a failure to effectively manage low income and affordable housing stocks within
our city.

The situation around the Road Home will be Noah's first priority. That shelter currently attempts
to serve 1,800 people in a facility with only 1,200 beds. The city must find temporary emergency space
to house this larger than expected community. The city must also expand mental health, substance use
prevention and rehabilitation, and community policing services in order to blunt the impact of these
temporary shelters on the surrounding communities.

In the medium term, we must look to expand shelter capacity permanently, not just in Salt Lake
but across the county. Although Salt Lake has only 17% of the residents of the county, we provide the
vast majority of shelter beds. Only one other city in the county, Midvale, has a homeless shelter. If the
other cities in the county do not want to house their homeless citizens, they should at least cover the
ongoing costs of Salt Lake City to do so. Salt Lake clearly has no problem providing services to the
homeless, we simply ask that other cities do their share to address this problem.

In the long term, our city must work to expand our inventory of low income and affordable
housing. This should include using all available funds from redevelopment agencies, which are already
set aside for this purpose, as well as seeking additional funding from our county, state, and federal
governments. Only by addressing the root cause of our homeless crisis will we tackle this problem for
future.
