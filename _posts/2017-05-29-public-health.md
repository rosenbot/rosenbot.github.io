Far too many of us know what it is like to lose a sibling, a parent, a friend, or a child to an
overdose. Our city finds itself in the grips of a deadly epidemic. Utah ranked ninth in the nation for
overdose deaths per capita in 2015. This situation is only getting worse, with a 4% increase in overdoses
from 2014. It is time for our city to take bold action to protect the public’s health. In the State Health
Department’s most recent needs assessment, four of Salt Lake City’s five regions ranked in the top third
of their opioid mortality and morbidity index.

Our city should dedicate funding in the next budget to provide low cost naloxone to those most
in need. This lifesaving drug reverses opioid overdoses in moments, much like an epi-pen works for a
serious allergic reaction. Like an epi-pen, it can often be prohibitively expensive. By offsetting the cost,
we can have a serious impact on the number of people who die in our living rooms as well as our
emergency rooms.

Those we save today, however, may have health problems which plague them for the rest of
their lives. Intravenous drug use is clearly tied to the spread of HIV and Hepatitis-C. While there are
treatments to give a high quality of life to those who suffer from these diseases, it is far less expensive
for our community to avoid these infections in the first place. One way to do this is to encourage the
expansion of needle exchange programs in our city. Needle exchange programs are endorsed by the
Center for Disease Control as the most effective approach for combating HIV and Hep C transmission.
The NIH found that these programs cut HIV transmission by between one 33%-40%. In addition,
participants in needle exchanges are five times more likely to enter drug treatment programs than non-
participants.
