The City Council should be a place for residents to make their voices heard in support of the
policies they agree with. For too long, the council has allowed the office of the mayor, both past and
current, to disregard the people of the city. Governing without allowing input from the residents of the
city simply because it is easier for the officials involved is a short-sighted and undemocratic approach.
Whether the decision is about bike lanes, a new street car expansion, site selection of new homeless
shelters or removal of existing ones, the lack of openness in the process is very frustrating to many
residents. Whether you approve of the ultimate decision or not, your voice should be heard throughout
the process to ensure that our city best reflects the opinions of its residents.
